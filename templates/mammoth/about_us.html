   <p> We decided to put this site together so we could form a larger wool loving herd, which currently consists of (update cookies to produce number of members) members. This has allowed us to share a vast number of lovely woolly patterns with you all. </p>
    <br />
<p>We showcase the top 5 patterns on our index page, all other patterns can be found via our gallery. Patterns and membership are free, it's all for the love of wool. Lets cause a hooley! </p>
